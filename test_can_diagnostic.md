## Expected Results

### If Everything Works:
- All tests should PASS
- Recommendations: "All systems appear to be working correctly"
- Messages should appear on page 3

### If There Are Issues:
- Failed tests will be marked with ‚ùå
- Specific recommendations will be provided
- Detailed error information will be shown

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Network Issues:
- Recommendation: "Connect to A0_CAN WiFi network"
- Check WiFi connection and SSID

### GVRET Issues:
- Recommendation: "Initialize GVRET client connection"
- Check Macchina A0 connectivity

### Fragment Issues:
- Recommendation: "Navigate to page 3 to initialize CANDataFragment"
- Ensure you're on the CAN Messages tab

### UI Issues:
- Recommendation: "Check RecyclerView and adapter setup"
- Verify fragment is properly initialized

## Next Steps

1. **Run the diagnostic** from page 3
2. **Review the results** and identify failed tests
3. **Follow the recommendations** provided
4. **Test again** after making changes
5. **Save or copy the report** for reference

The diagnostic system will help pinpoint exactly where the CAN message display issue is occurring and provide specific guidance on how to fix it.
